# Portfolio
This is a basic resume webpage project built using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript. It includes my personal information such as education, a summary, and some beginner-level project showcases instead of professional experience.

🔍 About the Project
This is my first step into web development.

I focused on learning and practicing core concepts of:

HTML structure

CSS styling and layout

Simple JS enhancements (like interactive features in future updates)

The design is clean and responsive, inspired by professional resumes but customized with my personal data.

It includes no backend, just static front-end code.

 Purpose
To understand how to structure content using HTML.

To explore styling and layout with CSS.

To slowly start practicing real-world mini-projects and build a portfolio.

This project is not final – it’s the beginning of my journey.

I plan to build similar and better projects by learning step-by-step.
